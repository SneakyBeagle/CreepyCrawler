# TO DO list for CreepyCrawler

## General
- [] Currently only supports root directory as starting point of crawling. Would be nice if this can be started from anywhere within the webdirectories
- [] Add custom header support
- [] Add custom cookie support
- [] Add support to add to existing file, without duplicates
- [x] Add timeout support

## Info gathering
- [] Search for form actions (HTML tags)
- [] Search for phone numbers
- [] Search for names (Based on list of known names? Or regex?)

## Maybe?
- [] Read request from file
- [] Support other request methods, and recognise when needing these
