# CreepyCrawler
Website crawler/spider, using regular expressions instead of standard scraping techniques

## Why?
I did not like any of the available webspiders/crawlers, so I decided
it was time to start building my own. Next to that, I wanted to
implement some advantages over other similar tools,
[read here about them](#advantages).
I use/plan on using this tool when doing reconnaissance with pentests
and such.

## Advantages
* Similar parameter usage as cURL (or at least, that is the aim)
* Regex to find links embedded in page source, instead of ready made
  scraping frameworks. This has the advantage of being able to find
  links, even when not embedded in html tags.
* Python
* Crossplatform
* Little dependencies

## Usage
Will write this when the tool is a bit further along.
